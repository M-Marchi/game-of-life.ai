# Game of Life AI

**Disclaimer: This project was started as a summer experiment and has been abandoned upon returning to work.**

## Overview

This repository contains an experimental simulation inspired by the classic "Game of Life," but with a twist: the goal was to create a world where animals and humans interact, with human behavior driven entirely by Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as their "brains."

## Project Status

This project is currently **inactive**. It was developed during my summer break as a fun and interesting challenge, but due to time constraints and work commitments, I am unable to continue its development for now. If I ever find the time and motivation in the future, I may revisit it, as I still find the idea intriguing.

## Concept

- **Humans**: Each human entity in the simulation is controlled by an LLM, making decisions and interacting with the world based on prompts and context.
- **Animals**: Animals follow simpler, rule-based behaviors.
- **World**: The simulation features a dynamic environment with trees, lakes, cows, and humans, all rendered using Pygame.

## Why Abandoned?

While the concept was promising and led to some interesting results, maintaining and developing such a project requires more time than I can currently dedicate. For now, this repository serves as a record of the experiment and a potential starting point for future work.
